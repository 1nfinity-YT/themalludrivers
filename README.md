This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction

Self-driving cars have become a hot topic in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize transportation. These cars can navigate and operate without human input, using a combination of sensors, cameras, and sophisticated algorithms. In order to build a self-driving car, various technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, and robotics are employed.

One such technology that can be used to create a self-driving car is Arduino. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It allows you to create interactive objects and projects that can sense and control the physical world.

Using an Arduino board, you can build a self-driving car that can sense its environment, make decisions, and drive on its own. The car can be equipped with a range of cameras such as pixy 2 that can detect obstacles and other objects in its path. It can also use machine learning algorithms to analyze and process data from these camera to make intelligent decisions.

In this documentation, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to build a self-driving car using Arduino. We will cover everything from selecting the right components to assembling and programming the car. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced electronics enthusiast, this guide will help you build your very own self-driving car using Arduino.
